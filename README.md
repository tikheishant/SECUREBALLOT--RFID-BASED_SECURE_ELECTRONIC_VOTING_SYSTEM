## 📌 Overview

**SecureBallot** is a real-time embedded application engineered to secure, automate, and streamline electoral operations. Built on the **NXP LPC2148 ARM7TDMI-S microcontroller**, it integrates RFID card authentication, matrix keypad password protection, I²C external EEPROM storage, an RTC clock, and an LCD dashboard interface to manage everything from voter registration to real-time vote tallying and tie detection.

The system enforces strict multi-role separation between **Election Officers** (admin operational mode) and **Voters** (polling mode), ensuring one-vote-per-voter enforcement backed by non-volatile storage.

> 💡 **Disclaimer:** *SecureBallot is an academic/embedded-systems prototype designed to demonstrate multi-peripheral interfacing, state machines, and non-volatile data management. Real elections require independent security assessments, tamper resistance, and formal regulatory compliance.*

```

Voter Authentication State                 System Action & Response
──────────────────────────────────────     ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
RFID Card Scanned                     →    Read 10-Byte Card ID via UART1
Card Found in EEPROM                  →    Check Active Flag (+0x0F)
Active Flag == 0x00 (Inactive)        →    🔴 Display "VOTER INACTIVE" & Reject
Active Flag == 0x01 (Active)          →    Check Voted Flag (+0x0E)
Voted Flag == 0x01 (Already Voted)    →    🔴 Display "ALREADY VOTED" & Reject
Voted Flag == 0x00 (Not Voted)        →    🟡 Prompt for 4-Digit Voter PIN
PIN Correct                           →    🟢 Grant Ballot Access → Record Vote → Mark Flag

## 🗃️ EEPROM Memory Mapping

The external AT24C256 EEPROM stores administrative credentials, voter records, election scheduling, and vote counts. Voter records follow a strict **20-byte record layout**:


```

Record Offset        Size (Bytes)        Stored Information
────────────────     ────────────        ───────────────────────────────────────
+0x00                10 Bytes            Voter RFID Tag ID
+0x0A                 4 Bytes            Voter 4-Digit Password PIN
+0x0E                 1 Byte             Voting-Status Flag (0x00: No, 0x01: Voted)
+0x0F                 1 Byte             Active Status Flag (0x01: Active, 0x00: Removed)
+0x10                 4 Bytes            Reserved / Future Metadata

## 💻 Software and Tools

| Tool / Software | Purpose / Details |
|---|---|
| **IDE** | Keil µVision 4 / 5 (ARM-MDK) |
| **Compiler** | Keil ARM C Compiler |
| **Microcontroller** | NXP LPC2148 (ARM7TDMI-S @ 60 MHz) |
| **Simulation Tool** | Proteus VSM (Simulation & Circuit Verification) |
| **Flash Tool** | Flash Magic (UART0 ISP Flashing) |
| **Language** | Embedded C |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/tikheishant/SECUREBALLOT--RFID-BASED_SECURE_ELECTRONIC_VOTING_SYSTEM.git](https://github.com/tikheishant/SECUREBALLOT--RFID-BASED_SECURE_ELECTRONIC_VOTING_SYSTEM.git)
cd SECUREBALLOT--RFID-BASED_SECURE_ELECTRONIC_VOTING_SYSTEM

```

### 2. Build the Project in Keil µVision

1. Open **Keil µVision**.
2. Select **File → Open Project** and locate the `.uvproj` file in the project root.
3. Ensure the target processor selected is **NXP LPC2148**.
4. Verify that all source files under `src/` and `apps/` are added to the build target.
5. Click **Build Target (F7)** to compile and generate the executable `.hex` file.

### 3. Flash Firmware

1. Connect the LPC2148 board to your system using a USB-to-UART converter attached to **UART0**.
2. Open **Flash Magic**, set the device to `LPC2148`, baud rate to `19200`, and select the generated `.hex` file.
3. Put the LPC2148 into ISP mode and click **Start** to program the microcontroller.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not execute full EEPROM format/initialization routines on every reboot, as this will reset configured voter records, passwords, and cast vote tallies.

## 🧪 Suggested Test Cases

* ✔️ **Officer Access:** Test authentication with valid vs. invalid Officer RFID cards and passwords.
* ✔️ **Voter Duplicate Guard:** Cast a vote for a registered user and attempt to scan the same RFID card again.
* ✔️ **Voter Removal:** Deactivate a voter record through the Officer menu and attempt to vote with that card.
* ✔️ **Incorrect Credentials:** Enter incorrect PINs during voter/officer authentication and verify lock-out behavior.
* ✔️ **Tally & Tie Detection:** Cast equal votes for two candidates and inspect the tie detection output on the Officer results screen.
* ✔️ **Power Cycle Persistence:** Disconnect power mid-election and verify that vote counts and voter status flags persist in EEPROM upon reboot.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* 🔐 **Cryptographic PIN Storage:** Hash voter PINs in EEPROM rather than storing plaintext values.
* 🧾 **Audit Trail:** Log all voter events with RTC timestamps to an encrypted transaction log.
* 🔋 **Power Loss Resilience:** Implement atomic double-buffered EEPROM writes to prevent data corruption during mid-write power loss.
* 🌐 **Wireless Dashboard:** Integrate an ESP32 bridge over UART to broadcast live election status to a remote monitoring site.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

* 🛠️ ARM7 LPC2148 hardware peripheral configuration (UART, I²C, RTC, GPIO).
* 💾 Low-level I²C protocol handling for external serial EEPROM read/write routines.
* 📊 Multi-role state machine design for secure embedded applications.
* 📡 Serial interrupt-driven data acquisition via RFID readers.
* 🖥️ Modular Embedded C system development and debugging.
